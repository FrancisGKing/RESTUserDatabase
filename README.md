This is a single page web app that displays the information of users, and allows for the addition and deletion of users. I created this project for additional practice with Javascript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Jade, as well as to gain more experience creating REST-ful web apps. I created this project using [this tutorial from Closebrace](https://closebrace.com/tutorials/2017-03-02/creating-a-simple-restful-web-app-with-nodejs-express-and-mongodb).
